# Local Binary Patterns and Color moments implementation using Python 3

`Local Binary Pattern (LBP)` is a simple yet very efficient texture operator which labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number.
`Color moments` are measures that characterise color distribution in an image in the same way that central moments uniquely describe a probability distribution.

## Packages Used
The program is coded using Windows 7 (64 bit) operating system with Python version 3.7.4

The following packages are necessary to run the program:

Package
**OpenCV**
**Numpy**
**scikit-image**
**json**
**configparser**
**pymongo**
